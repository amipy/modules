# modules
A nice little repository with a fer moduled i wrote in it.

1:
  The Form module
  To import it, type "from form import form"
  Create a form by using "newForm=form()"
  To add a question to the form, type "newform.add("Question here")"
  To make the user answer the form, use "newForm.ask()"
  If you do not want the question number on the side while asking, type "newForm.ask(showNumber=False)"
  If you want to show how many questions there are as well, IE: "1/10", type newForm.ask(showRemaining=True)"
  Subtitude newForm for the name of your form.
